    <p>The Santiago Chamber of Commerce acts as a community helper, connecting startups in the city with people that
        desire to start or cntinue a career, so they can learn what skills are more important for the jobs the startups
        require, and how they can get those skills, certificates or degrees in the shorter period of time, or how can
        they be more competitive for getting the right job in the shortest time possible. also this chamber of commerce
        allows startup owners and workers to connect with individuals that might be interested in being hired in their
        companies, so they can provide insight about the common positions needed in their companies, as well as what are
        the challenges the workers are facing, so those future applicants to those jobs can know how to prepare better.
        Big companies are also invited to help the community in their efforts of getting a better job.</p>
